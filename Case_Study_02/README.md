Although the case study provides 18 files, comprehensively covering daily data, hourly data and minute data, the most relevant ones are daily data for one month.

I try to find out if this is the first party data or third party data, but I have no clue where other participants find all these data is from Amazon.

The first party and third party data would make a big difference for the reliability and credibility, and thus affects the final insights of the analysis.

1st party data would be very reliable and does not have any problem with licensing issues, while 3rd party one would be subject to errors and other annoying issues.

As we have no other approaches to obtain more reliable data, we have no choice but to accept the data received is aligned with ROCCC rules.
